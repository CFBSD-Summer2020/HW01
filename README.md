# HW01. Ricardo Muñiz's Bio

## Introduction

Hi, my name is **Ricardo Muñiz Trejo**, I'm **27** years old, and I'm **Mexican**. I was admitted to the **Ecology & Evolution** Ph.D. program, and I'm very excited about it!

I've lived in Mexico City my whole life, so moving to Chicago will be a novel experience. Let's just hope I can go there, given the pandemics. Speaking of which, here's a picture of me *rocking* a mask \#BeSafe \#WearAMask.

## Education

I majored in **Biology** at the **National Autonomous University of Mexico**. Currently, I'm finishig my master's in **Biochemistry** at the same University. I worked my thesis at the [**Physical-Chemistry and Protein Engineering Lab**](http://lipasa.fmedic.unam.mx/LFQIP/ "Content in Spanish"). My lab is massive in size since five PIs are developing cojoined projects:

* Dr. Georgina Garza
* Dr. Alejandro Sosa
* Dr. Mario Calcagno
* Dr. Ismael Bustos
* Dr. Alejandro Fernández (my advisor)

## Contact

You can folow me on Twitter [@tmr_68](https://twitter.com/tmr_68 "My Twitter account") but be mindful mine isn't an academic account, so expect a lot of inane and pointless material.
