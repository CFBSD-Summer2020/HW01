## Brief Biography

My name is **Nabilah** and I am from **Malaysia**. I graduated from **Purdue University** back in 2017 and I am currently working as a research technician in the same lab I did my research as an undergraduate. 

I am interested in studying *Learning and Memory* at the *cell, molecular level* as well as potentially using *computational techniques* in my research. Although I have very little background in coding, I believe that it is an invaluable skill in doing my PhD and I am excited to learn more through this class!

### Hobbies

* Baking 
* Cooking
* Reading
* Hiking

I recently stumbled across this beautiful sunset picture and it is my current favorite image.
