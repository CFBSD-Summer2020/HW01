## About Me
Hi!  My name is Ariana and I am from Hope, Rhode Island.  I am an incoming Ph.D. Student at **The University of Chicago** in the *Committee on Computational Neuroscience*.  Currently, I am interested in studying motor control and proprioception.  I am interested in how these properties work together through sensori-motor integration to allow an individual to successfully perform goal-directed behaviors such as reaching out to pick up an object.

I just graduated from **Boston University** this past May with my *B.A. in Neuroscience*.  During my time at BU, I worked in the [Hasselmo Lab](https://www.bu.edu/hasselmo/) and the [Theoretical Cognitive Neuroscience Lab](http://sites.bu.edu/tcn/) where I studied hippocampal time cells.  While most people are typically aware of spatial mapping (i.e. hippocampal place cells), more recent studies provide evidence in support of distinct temporal mapping in the hippocampus. This temporal organization occurs via sequences of neurons that fire at specific moments during temporally structured events. These neurons have become known as “time cells”.
