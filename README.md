# Hello Class!

My name is Daniel and I'm from Poland. I arrived to the US about three years ago for an internship at UChicago. Afterwards I decided to stay in this beautiful country for a bit longer. Now I'm happy to be starting a PhD studies on the BMB program here!

I was born in Poland in a city of Bielsko-Biala, located in southern Poland - medium-sized (for polish standards) and surrounded by old, green mountains, that greatly add to its charm.

[This link](https://wseh.pl/pl/galeria/witamy-w-gorach-witamy-w-bielsku-bialej.html) has more pictures of my home town.

Later I moved to Cracow to study *biotechnology* at __Jagiellonian University__. At this school I obtained my B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees as well as gained great experience in the wet lab.

I hope this course will allow me to become more familiar with:

* Using github
* Basics of programming in R
