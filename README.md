## Biography
* My name is **Patrick Cantwell** and I am an incoming biochemistry and molecular biophysics Ph.D. student.
* This is a picture of me from a few weeks ago with the longest hair I've ever had

  * I luckily got it cut a few days ago for the first time in ~6 months, but I don't have a picture of that.
* I am from Glastonbury, Connecticut and I finished my undergrad at UConn back in December. If you are interested in how different UConn is from UChicago, **[this is what it looks like](https://goo.gl/maps/K6Ymg1L4GT4nM1nB6)**.
* Outside of my academic interests, I like photography, especially timelapse and long exposure photography. Both of these styles of photography work great in cities and by bodies of water, so I am very excited to take some pictures of Lake Michigan!
