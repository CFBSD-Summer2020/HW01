**Hi Everyone**

My name is *Sandra McClure* and I am a second year PHD student in *the committe on Molecular Metabolism and Nutrition*. I work in the Mimee Lab [https://voices.uchicago.edu/mimeelab/] on engineering the gut microbiome. I went to undergrad at Michigan State University for chemistry and biology, where I also did research in analytical electrochemistry. 

Here is a picture of me from a pre-COVID era:

Here are some things I have done over quarantine
<ul>
  <li>Started a paint by number</li>
  <li>Learned how to do embrodery</li>
  <li>Read some sappy romance novels</li>
  <li>Spent 7 weeks living with my parents o.o</li>
  <li>Did not make sourdough bread
    <ul>
      <li>#glutenfree</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Got an *impressive* sunburn this past weekend after spending months inside</li>
  </li>
</ul>

I hope I'm doing this correctly, as I don't have much experience coding. I appreciate the organization that comes along with using Markdown. I mostly google the bumps I have come across, which seems to be quite effective!
