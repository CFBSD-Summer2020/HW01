# Idongesit Ekpo's Bio for HW 1
Hello, my name is Idongesit Ekpo and I have lived in Utah for the past **four years**. Before living in Utah, I lived in FCT Abuja, Imo and Lagos. These are all Nigerian territories and states. Living in these places has shaped my life and how I interact with people. One life lesson that I learnt from all these places is that ***everyone has a story.*** Some of my hobbies are listed below. They include:
* Reading
  * I am currently reading _23 Things They Didn't Tell You About Capitalism_
* Hiking
  * One hobby I developed as a result of living in Utah. Utah has **MOUNTAINS** everywhere. Here's a picture of Deer Valley Mountain

* Meeting new people 
* Weight Lifting
* Participating in adrenaline activities.
  * I'm currently looking into crazy bungee jumps.
