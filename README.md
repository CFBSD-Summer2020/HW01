# HW01. Ricardo Muñiz's Bio

## Introduction

Hi, my name is **Ricardo Muñiz Trejo**, I'm **27** years old, and I'm **mexican**. I was admitted into the **Ecology & Evolution** PhD program. I'm very excited to get to know everyone! 

## Education

I majored in *Biology* at the *National Autonomous University of Mexico*. Later, I got my master's degree in *Biochemistry* at the same University.

I work at the Physical-Chemistry and Protein Engineering Lab. This lab is very big, since there are five PIs:

* Dr. Georgina Garza
* Dr. Alejandro Sosa
* Dr. Mario Calcagno
* Dr. Ismael Bustos
* Dr. Alejandro Fernández (my boss)

Here a recent photo of the members of the lab:

You can folow me on Twitter [@tmr_68](https://twitter.com/tmr_68 "My twitter account") but be mindful that mine isn't an academic account, so expect a lot of inane stuff.
