## First year graduate student in DRSB
I have lived in Illinois my whole life in the city of Aurora. I just graduated with two bachelors degrees. One in biological sciences and the other in Biochemistry from Northern Illinois University.
I have two cats named sophie and sky which can be seen below. They are little **monsters**.
