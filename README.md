# Laura Cespedes Biography
## Early years
I grew up in a city in Colombia called  [Bucaramanga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucaramanga). This city is close to a prominent geographic feature called the [Chicamocha Canyon](https://colombia.travel/en/blog/majestic-chicamocha-canyon). My mom name is Maria and we had a dog named Simon

## College and professional career
I moved to the capital of Colombia, named Bogota, to study **Biology**. There I became interested in **birds** and **evolution**. I have lived and worked in this city ever since. During my career I have had the chance of doing fieldwork in a wide variety of places across Colombia and other South American countries, for example:

* Manu Road, Peru

* Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, Colombia

* Papallacta, Ecuador
