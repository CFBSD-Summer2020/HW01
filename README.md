### Biography of Nick

Howdy! I'm Nick Elliott, a new DRSB recruit. I'll keep this short and sweet, 
just like me. I grew up in the small town of Ramona, east of San Diego. 
My passion for biology began with dinosaurs and Steve Erwin. I eventually 
pursued this passion to San Diego Sate University, where I recieved my BS 
degree. I had my first research experience in Dr. Tanya Renner's Lab. We 
investgigated carnivorous plant evolution through their chitinase enzymes. 
Interestingly, carnivory seems to have developed several times from a fungal 
pathogen response. We looked at the Sundew: *Drosera capensis*

After a year in the Renner Lab, I left to begin an internship with the 
California Institute for Regenerative Medicine, CIRM. I completed this work at 
the Salk Institute. There I worked under Dr. Diana Hargreaves and Dr. Fangjian 
Gao to study the BAF complex. The BAF complex is a chromatin remodeler important
for reguation in most tissue types. We focused on its role in neural 
developement and mutations that contribute to intellectual diability. 
Dr. Hargreaves was gracious enough to keep me on after the end of my internship 
and I'm still working at the Salk now. Here's a [link to the lab!](https://hargreaves.salk.edu/) 
My experience with CIRM and the Hargreaves Lab encouraged me to go for a PhD in 
developemental biology. I'm so stoked to be attending UChicago this fall. Can't 
wait to meet all of my fellow trainees. 
To wrap up the features, here's a bullet list of a few of my hobbies and 
interests:
*Sufing
* Backpacking and camping
* Reading, mostly Sci-fi
* Evolutionary biology, still a dinosaur nut
* DnD, since quarantine at least
