Just a few weeks ago, I graduated from Northwestern University with a degree in Biochemistry. I grew up in **Des Plaines, Illinois** and my family currently lives in **Deer Park, Illinois**... it's safe to say that I'll feel right at home at UC! I'm very much looking forward to starting my first year as a BMB student this fall.
<br><br>
Though I'm deep-rooted in Illinois, both of my parents grew up in **Poland**, so my body composition is 50% pierogi and 50% wódka. In all seriousness, I'm so proud of my heritage and am incredibly grateful to be a first-generation American.

Hopefully, I'll get to know many of you in real life soon! Mrs. 'Rona has definitely been a lot to swallow for an extrovert like me. To finish, I'll leave y'all with my favorite quote at the moment and a photo of my bernadoodle, Bambi:
