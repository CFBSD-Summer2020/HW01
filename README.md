#*Hi*, **Duhman here** ---  
I'm from Jordan -- details follow in our future casual conversations when we finally meet -- and I'm joining the Human Genetics graduate program.  
I found this **cheatsheet** on RMarkdown very helpful: [link](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf?_ga=2.258946250.1792551844.1594180741-1708049985.1592619774)  
I hope it worked!
