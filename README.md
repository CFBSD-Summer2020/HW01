Hello all!
My name is Ben, I'm an incoming first year student in the **University of Chicago** *Neurobiology* program [link here](https://neuroscience.uchicago.edu/). I am interested in studying the molecular mechanisms behind automatic functions such as breathing, pain and prioprioception. I have no prior experience in coding but have always been interested in learning!

I am originally from Winnipeg, Canada, and came to the US for college. I majored in molecular and cellular biology and minored in music.

Some of my hobbies/interests:

* Piano
* Ultimate frisbee
* Traveling and trying to memorize random phrases from obscure local languages
* Running
   * Heading along the lakeshore in the mornings, give me a shout if you also like running!
