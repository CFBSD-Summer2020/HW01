## Quick Bio of Hannah Farrell

I am a rising second year PhD student in the Integrative Biology program.  
I study human evolution, but more specifically, I am interested in the upper limb morphology of *Australopithecus afarensis*. *A. afarensis* is a **hominin**, or an evolutionary ancestor of modern humans.  
I also love to cook and bake, here are some of my favorite things to make:  
1. Challah bread   
2. Chicken and dumplings soup  
3. Homemade pasta
