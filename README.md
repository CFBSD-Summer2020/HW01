### Biography   

Hi all! My name is Patrick Haller, and I'm an incoming **Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics** student. I was born and raised in Basel, Switzerland. Here's a picture of my hometown:   

I moved to the U.S. at the age of 16. This past spring, I graduated from the [University of Miami](https://welcome.miami.edu/), where I worked in a *Schizosaccharomyces pombe* lab.    

In my spare time, I really enjoy playing soccer and staying active.   
Additionally, I also like to:   
- watch new movies and listen to music   
- spend time with family and friends   

That's about it from me
