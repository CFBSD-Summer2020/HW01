Hi everyone,

I am **Xing Yanfeng** from China. I was born and grew up in *Shanxi*, a province in central China, and I just graduated from Tsinghua University. I worked in [Zhu Lab](http://zhulab.life.tsinghua.edu.cn/) for two years at Tsinghua. Our group focuses on mirror-image biology.

I think Chinese foods are delicious, like

* noodles
* dumplings
* Peking Duck
* and some traditional snacks

Hope to see you soon at UChicago!
