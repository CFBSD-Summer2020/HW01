# My life in Quarantine
### Althea Bock-Hughes

## Quarantine projects included:

* Knitting

* Baking Sourdough Bread

* Watching "Avatar the Last Airbender" for the first time 

* Tanning 

* Occasionally thinking about science 

My most involved project was **knitting** 
I knit *four* sweaters in Quarantine

1. This was the first one I knit and the hardest
